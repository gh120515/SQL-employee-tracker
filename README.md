# Employee Tracker (powered by SQL)

## Description

This JavaScript based application will allow the user to track employees in an organisation.

<!-- TODO: FULL APP DESCRIPTION -->

<!-- Express.js is used as a basis for back-end operations, which is used to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This is the builder's first experience in building a full-stack app, incorporating the front-end with the back-end of a web app. -->


## Installation

It is assumed that the user of this app has some basic knowledge in code editing (the app itself can be used through the below steps).

The following are required to use this app:

1. Download the repository 

You can do this through the 'Code' button above this README; for example, you can clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Node.js

You can skip this step if you already have Node.js in your local machine - you can check your current version in your terminal through the below command:

    node -v

Otherwise, [this link](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/) will highlight some common options to install Node.js - do note that the process may vary between MacOS, Windows and Linux.

Functionality has been confirmed on Node.js version 16.20.0. Note that other versions may not function as intended.

## Usage

After performing the basic setup, open the repository that you downloaded / cloned - you can do this in multiple ways, such as through the terminal.

The most convinient method is through VS Code (source-code editor program), which has a function where you can directly open the terminal in the directory (right-click on the 'Develop' folder, then select 'Open in Integrated Terminal').
